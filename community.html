					<h3>Value Pillars</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="values">
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Community</p>
						<p class="text">We envision a world where community re-emerges as a centerpiece of human life. Through our interconnected, we build resilience and foster growth and innovation, laughter and play.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Care</p>
						<p class="text">We believe that care and compassion is the key any healthy community, regardless the scale. Leaning in and giving opening with the attitude that "it all comes around" creates an atmosphere of trust and abundance.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Sustainability</p>
						<p class="text">We envision a world where human systems are designed regeneratively, and we regain our harmony with the natural environment. Living in groups can help us towards this means by constructing low-impact buildings and having the community utilize shared resources. Not only are these methods better for the environment, they end up reducing the costs each member pays as well.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Do-ocracy</p>
						<p class="text">We believe in giving members the flexibility to build and design their world's to the highest degree of freedom . We seek to tow the line between overly-ordered and overly-anarchistic by implementing a do-ocracy: members are encouraged to build, whether physically or socially, the community they want to see with the minimal amount of permission-seeking possible. Consesus is required for more impactful, irreversible initiatives, but for everything else, we trust your insight!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Curiosity</p>
						<p class="text">We believe that approaching the world with an innate sense of humble curiosity helps us learn and connect. Through staying open-minded, we can learn from others' experiences, reduce conflicts, and create an environment of healthy self-expression.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Learning and Teaching</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="learning-description">
					<p>We see a lack of post-college learning and teaching structures in the world. Cosm is providing the template structure for peer-to-peer skillsharing</p>
					<ul class="bullets">
						<li>Want to teach morning yoga? Learn how to surf? Go deeper into differential equations? Teaching is the highest form of learning, and we want to help you learn and teach the things that captivate your interest.</li>
						<li>Each quarter, we members can come up with a class they would like to teach or project they would like to undertake. As a group, we put together a 'syllabus' with scheduled meeting times, a content overview, and a final project. Additionally, <i>Cosm will offer funding needed to make the project happen.</i></li>
						<li>Through formally structuring this into the community, we facility peer-to-peer knowledge transfer and build accountability for our goals. The final projects solidifies the learnings of the project into a tangible form that will last across time.</li>
						<li>We plan to expand this to host residencies. Think artist-in-residency, writer-retreats, professor-sabatticals. The person in residency will have a peaceful retreat space for deepwork, as well as the opportunity to teach the community about their projects, processes, or research</li>

					<h3>Network Effect</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="network">
					<div class="network-description">
						<ul class="bullets">
							<li>We've found that communities do best through organic growth. Each Cosm community gains members through first-degree connections &#8212; you live in the community, and your friend wants to join; because I like you and we have things in common, I'll likely have things in common with your friend; your friend goes through a short application process, and is brought into the community upon consensus</li>
							<li>In past experiments, we've found that this method of organic growth results in socially cohesive communities and an overflow of people wanting to join.</li>
							<li>As Cosm scales, we aim to have locations across the United States, and eventually across the globe, with the intent of providing a network effect for members: travel across Cosm locations while staying deeply rooted in communal connection. This allows you to experience.</li>
							<li>This allows individuals to travel between stunning and unique locations, whether for work or for fun, while staying tapped into a community and maintaining a setup optimized for remote work. Communities, in return, never stagnate and have a constant influx of new ideas and perspectives.</li>
							<li>Eventually, we seek to partner with pre-existing co-living housing to provide greater locational flexibility, and eventually aim to become a meta-platform for co-living connection.</li>

					<h3>Design Pillars</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="design-values">
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Fractal Design</p>
						<p class="text">Following the theory laid out in A Pattern Language, we see reflection between the design of cities to communities to houses to individual rooms.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Regenerative Systems</p>
						<p class="text">Building for energy and resource use efficiency mitigates environmental and financial impact. Our design choices, from the choice of hyper-efficient dwelling units, to implementing composting and a community garden, to building systems for recycling grey water all aim at finding sustainable equilibrium with our surrounding environment.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Human-Centered Design</p>
						<p class="text">We are designing with you in mind, and our goal is maximal interconnected and independence. We're all about community, and therefore want to maximize the utility of communal spaces, such as media rooms, gyms, group kitchens, gardens, and multipurpose event space. However, it is just as important to maximize individual autonomy, done through private, detatched sleeping units, workspaces design for you to do whatever you're best at, and access to shared community resources and vehicles so you can run your own projects and adventures.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="pillar">
						<p class="header">Flexible Structures</p>
						<p class="text">Fully top-down design is too rigid and static. We will leave certain spaces open for crowd-sourced design. Cosm.Cashmere has a 6,000sqft warehouse on property. Should it be makerspace? What about an engineering or neuroscience laboratory? How about an indoor climbing gym? Or all three? Let's decide together.</p>

					<h3>Sleeping Space</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="unit-description">
					<div class="unit-text">
						<p>The layout of our communities: central hubs for group interactions surrounded by detatched dwelling units.</p>
						<ul class="bullets">
							<li>Detached units will be approximately 440sqft, similar to the size of a small studio apartment, and will be fully furnished.</li>
							<li>We are using geodesic domes made by <a href="https://pacificdomes.com/"target="_blank">Pacific Domes</a> for these studio units. Pacific Domes are energy efficient, extremely durable, have spacious and zen interiors, are and relative easy to work into zoning codes.</li>
							<li>Each unit will have a king-sized bed, office space, storage room, and full master bathroom.</li>
							<li>We are developing properties in a truly unique way, with the goal of creating the ideal group living and working flow. Do to the unique nature, permitting and zoning is a major obstacle, but we have found success by categorizing this development as a "nature retreat glamping operation" within most zoning codes.</li>

					<p>Maintaining a home is difficult work, especially when occupied by a large group. Cosm takes the stress out of this process by taking care of space.
					<ul class="bullets">
						<li>Cosm handles all property management tasks, including things like building maintenance and landscaping.</li>
						<li>Keeping group areas clean is a major friction point in most co-living houses. Cosm employs weekly cleaners to take care of this</li>
