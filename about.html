				<h2>Origin Story</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="description-text">
				<p class="top-text">This project start in late 2019 as an attempt to answer the question: &#8220What would the ideal living situation look like?&#8221</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">We spent the first six months researching as much theory behind community and the built environment as we could think of &#8212 everything from anthropology, sustainable design, architecture, social psychology, group dynamics, neuroscience, and beyond.</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">We&#39;ve converged to a rather simple, intuitive answer: us humans maximally flourish when living in tight knit cohorts, staying connected to nature, working on meaningful problems, and staying humbly oriented toward perpetual growth and learning. </p>
				<p class ="middle-text">To our surprise, we struggled to find many examples of this. Instead, we saw our peers struggling to meet each of these needs while renting city apartments or suburban homes, and watched an impersonal, uncaring, and stagnate real estate empire fail to innovate. So, we decided to take matters into our own hands...</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">We are building small communities oriented around learning at teaching. When evaluating potential properties and planning developments, we seek to maximize three things:</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>Large community spaces to foster collaboration and connection: big kitchens and living rooms, plenty of space to work on collaborative projects, ample surrounding outdoors space.</li>
					<li>Ample private space, so everyone can optimize their personal lives and fully decompress as desired: private, spacious rooms as well as fully detached, private units.</li>
					<li>Beautiful surrounding environments: properties with plenty of acreage for outside projects and activities, and plentiful local opportunities for natural immersion and outdoor recreation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="bottom-text">We truly believe that this model of living can help humans become happier, more connected, and more innovative. The future is bright, see you there :) </p>
