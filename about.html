				<h2>Origin Story</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="description-text">
				<p class="top-text">This project started as an attempt to answer the question: &#8220What would the ideal community look like?&#8221</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">Exiting college, we were disillusioned with the lack of meaningful connection found in traditional housing models. We couldn&#39t find anyone in our network truly satisfied with the design of their community, whether urban, suburban, or rural.</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">Inspired by the rising success coliving movements and the exponentially growing investment in the space, we set out to design a flexible and scalable blueprint for coliving communities.</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">Grassroots coliving houses are decentralized &#8212 none have figured out how to scale and interconnect with other community pods while retaining the strength and flexibility of their individual personality.</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">Large-scale coliving companies simply lease and rebrand multi-family buildings &#8212 this increases profit margins, but does little to actually foster community.</p>
				<p class ="middle-text">Cosm is engineering the full coliving stack:</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>Directly purchasing property: no money lost through middling leases &#8594 lower rent</li>
					<li>Designing the built environment specifically for coliving and coworking &#8594 intentional design, not repurposed apartments</li>
					<li>Developing scalable network-selection processes &#8594 enable communities to remain at full occupany while also retaining their unique culture and values </li>
					<li>Providing flexible ammenities and community management services &#8594 removing the logistic difficulties behind renting</li>
					<li>Creating a network effect between coliving locations &#8594 connect locally and travel globally</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p class="bottom-text">We truly believe that this model of living can help us become happier, more connected, and more innovative. The future is bright, see you there :)</p>
